Package float helps you compare floats.

Just as `1/3` cannot be exactly represented in the decimal system, so numbers
such as `0.1` cannot be exactly represented in the binary system. This can make
testing with floats very frustrating. This package aims to aid you in that.

For more information, see the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/goulash/float)! :-)
