Package float helps you compare floats.

*Warning*: this package is not yet ready for use.

Just as `1/3` cannot be exactly represented in the decimal system, so numbers
such as `0.1` cannot be exactly represented in the binary system. This can make
testing with floats very frustrating. This package aims to aid you in that.

Make sure you read Bruce Dawson's excellent
[series](https://randomascii.wordpress.com/2012/02/25/comparing-floating-point-numbers-2012-edition)
on floating point numbers.

For more information, see the [documentation](http://godoc.org/github.com/goulash/float)! :-)
